# distributed points Molecular Dynamics using Normal Modes

`distributed points Molecular Dynamics using Normal Modes` (dpMDNM) is an enhanced-sampling approach that allows large protein conformational sampling based on `normal mode` (NM) vectors. dpMDNM generates harmonically restrained structures along NM vectors that are further relaxed with standard MD simulations to fill the conformational space.

NM-driven enhanced-sampling methods highly depend on the set of NM vectors. To guarantee an optional protein conformational sampling with dpMDNM, we employed `uniformly oriented NM vectors`, generated by a minimization script developed by our team called [PDIM](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMDNM/tree/main/PDIM).

### How does dpMDNM work?
Before performing conformational sampling with dpMDNM, a `preparation` step is necessary. Firstly, the protein of interest must be subjected to an `equilibration` step. Following, the protein is (in this case) minimized before `NM calculations`. Then, uniformly oriented vectors obtained from [PDIM](https://github.com/antonielgomes/dpMDNM/tree/main/PDIM) are used as weights for a `uniform NM combination` of the most relevant (usually low-frequency) modes.
Once all this information is ready, dpMDNM will be performed in three stages:

- dpVAC: the same (vacuum minimized) structure used in NM calculations is subjected to a series of positional restraints potentials to generate structures properly distributed along NM vectors using [VMOD](https://doi.org/10.1016/0010-4655(95)00052-H).
- dpSOL: [Targeted Molecular Dynamics (TMD)](https://doi.org/10.1080/08927029308022170) simulations are conducted for the solvated system, driving the protein towards those structures obtained in the first stage.
- dpMDNM: all solvated conformations obtained in the preceding stage are further equilibrated and subjected to standard MD simulations to obtain an equilibrated unbiased conformational ensemble.

The ensemble of structures obtained in the third stage corresponds to the conformational exploration performed by dpMDNM, which can provide insights into protein structure, dynamics, and function.

### Why use dpMDNM?

The imposed positional restraints along uniformly combined NM vectors followed by standard MD simulations allow dpMDNM to generate an extensive conformational exploration, outperforming the powerful enhanced-sampling method developed by our team called [MDeNM](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00003). Therefore, dpMDNM is a promising alternative for conducting protein conformational sampling, providing valuable contributions in the field, such as:
- Rational protein conformational sampling.
- Systematic exploration of the NM space.
- Coverage of experimental structures.
- Identification of energetically favorable regions in the conformational space.
- Insights into dynamical and functional aspects of proteins.

In addition, dpMDNM can be adapted to `any NM vectors` obtained from other techniques or `Principal Component Analysis (PCA)` obtained by standard MD simulations or experimental conformations.
